Current State

  - kaiba.test is NOT set up - you're using localhost:8000
  - You're in a Valet directory but haven't linked this project
  - APP_URL is set to http://localhost:8000

  Recommended Development Workflow

  Option 1: Set up Valet link (Recommended)

  # Link this project to kaiba.test
  valet link kaiba

  # Update your .env file
  APP_URL=http://kaiba.test
  SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=kaiba.test,127.0.0.1,localhost

  # Build assets once for development
  npm run build

  # Now kaiba.test will serve your app without needing npm run dev

  Option 2: Use the existing composer dev command

  # This runs all services together (as shown in CLAUDE.md)
  composer run dev
  # This starts: Laravel server, Vite dev server, queue worker, logs

  Option 3: Quick development server

  # Just start Laravel (assets served from last build)
  php artisan serve
  # Visit: http://localhost:8000

  Best Workflow for You

  For rapid development:
  1. Set up kaiba.test (one-time setup):
  valet link kaiba
  npm run build  # Build assets once
  2. Update .env:
  APP_URL=http://kaiba.test
  SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=kaiba.test
  3. Daily workflow:
    - Just visit http://kaiba.test - no servers to start!
    - Only run npm run build when you change frontend code
    - Only run composer run dev when you need live reload/HMR

  Answer to your question: No, kaiba.test is not currently set up, but
  it should be! Once you set it up with Valet, you won't need to run any
   servers - just visit the URL and your app will work with the last
  built assets.
